# Production Helpers

Scripts to ease the use of interactive processing environment.

There are detailed descriptions in the different subdirectories:

cloud          : tools that need to be in $HOME on a machine that has access to the worker nodes on a cloud

cloudscheduler : tools that need to be in $HOME on the machine that has cloudscheduler installed

local          : tools that need to be in $HOME on a local machine that has ssh access to the machine that runs cloudscheduler and to the machine that has access to the worker nodes on a cloud


CURRENTLY in BETA STATE UNTIL THIS LINE IS REMOVED, usability for Atlas jobs needs to be tested.
